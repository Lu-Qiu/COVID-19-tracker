## COVID-19-Tracker

This GitHub page contains the code for the Shiny app developed by Lu Qiu, a student from South China University of Technology. This is part of her work in the project "Date Visualization and Web Application"

Raw data are obtained from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series and updated daily.

This Shiny app aims to visualize:

●  Distribution of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths globally in map format

● Changes of the number of confirmed cases over time via line graph

● Summary statistics of data

● Top countries with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths using bar chart
