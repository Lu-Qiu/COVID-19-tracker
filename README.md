## COVID-19-tracker

This github page contains the code for the Shiny APP developed by Lu Qiu, a student from South China University of Technology. This is part of her work in the project "Date Visualization and Web Application"

Input data are obtained from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering github page and are updated daily.

This Shiny App aims to provide:
● a map that shows the world distribution of the number of confirmed cases and deaths 
● a time-series line graph that shows the changes in the number of confirmed cases over time
● a chart to display the data
● bar graphs that show the top ten countries with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths
