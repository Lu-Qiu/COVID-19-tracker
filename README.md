## COVID-19-tracker

This github page contains the code for the Shiny app developed by Lu Qiu, a student from South China University of Technology. This is part of her work in the project "Date Visualization and Web Application"

Input data are obtained from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series and are updated daily.

This Shiny app aims to provide:

● a map that shows the world distribution of the number of confirmed cases and deaths 

● a time-series line graph that shows the changes in the number of confirmed cases over time

● a chart to display the data

● bar graphs that show the top ten countries with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths
